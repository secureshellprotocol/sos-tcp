SOS is a game like tic tac toe, except its with S's and O's, and instead of
making a line of the same character, each player can choose to place either
an S or an O. A player scores when they make a sequence S-O-S in any direction.

Building:
Makefile is provided.
Run "make" in the source directory, a binary should appear in bin/
Run "make clean" to rm all binaries and .o files.

This is just a personal project.
goals for myself
* working TCP implementation for over the network play.
* proper AI with tune-able difficulty
	* once a static map is made, a "nav mesh" is made so its quicker to know
	where specific tiles are relative to a specific index on the board.
	* generating AI moves with a helper program, making use of whatever
	game theory i can make sense of because it seems fun idk
